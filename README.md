# Growth

Interactive simulations of growth in hyperelastic materials, written in JavaScript.

The development and evolution of complex neocortical organisations is thought to result from the interaction of genetic and activity-dependent processes. But a third type of process – mechanical morphogenesis – may also play an important role. Homogeneous growth of elastic tissues can induce a rich variety of forms (including folding), with heterogeneous patterns of residual stress.

Here we provide an intuitive introduction to the physics of buckling using interactive, open source implementations of different mechanical systems. The simulations run directly on the web browsers, without any other software.
